# Getting Started

## Getting Access to Classy

If you do not have access to our Classy platform, or if you are unsure, contact your supervisor or database administrator. They will provide your credentials, or create them if they do not already exist.

## Classy Gift Reports

Before you can download the gift data and import it into a Raiser's Edge batch, you will need to follow the below instructions to properly configure your Classy reports and exports so they can be handled by our macro.

### One-Time Classy Gifts

    3. The page should refresh and show this new report.
    4. **Note:** this is YOUR individual report, if changes are made and saved, it will not affect the report for others.

??? info "What is a one-time Classy gift?"

    A one-time Classy gift is a single, non-recurring donation made through the Classy platform. Donors can contribute a specific amount to support a fundraising campaign or cause without committing to ongoing contributions. One-time gifts are typically made via credit card, debit card, or other payment methods supported by Classy, and they provide immediate financial support for our initiatives.

#### Exporting One-Time Gifts Data

1. Open the *One-Time Classy Gifts v8* report.
2. Set the **Transaction Date** range. *Note: see "Selecting the correct Classy transaction date range" below about determining the transaction date, if this is your first time.*
3. **Note:** The Filters, Columns, and Custom Questions do not need to be changed per export - these reflect our ImportOmatic profile to import Classy data into RE. If/When the ImportOmatic profile is updated, these fields will also need to be updated accordingly.
    1. **Filters = Recurring Plan ID** is blank (only one-time gifts) and **Internal Campaign Name** is not equal to MBG (Mudbone Grown has a separate export as its one of our Fiscal Sponsor entities).
    2. **Columns = 56 options** selected to match the Excel Macro and our import profile.
    3. **Custom Question** = the additional Org question that Classy introduced outside of the *Columns* option.
4. **Save Changes** after dates are applied.
5. Export the report by clicking the small download icon at the top right portion of the Classy window. The correct button has a tooltip that reads "Export report as .CSV" for reference.
6. A pop up "Export data as .CSV file" pop up window will appear. In the `Select a specific timezone` field, verify that *Pacific Daylight Time - Los Angeles* is selected (should be by default).
7. Click **Start Export**.
8. When saving the file, use the naming convention: *MM.DD.YY - MM.DD.YY - Classy 1x Gifts* and save in the following location:

```text
S:\Development\Applications\Classy\Gift Exports\Classy Gift Exports FYXX-XX\Current Month
```

??? danger "Selecting the correct Classy transaction date range"

    It is essential to select the correct transaction date range when exporting Classy gifts to prevent duplicate and missing gifts. First, it's important to know that the **transaction date range is inclusive**. For example, a selected date range of 10/01/24 - 10/05/24 includes gifts from 10/01 and 10/05 in the exported report. Second, **DO NOT** ever select the current day (today's date) as the end date of the report. This may lead to missing gifts (gifts submitted on the same day but after you have exported the report) or duplicate gifts, as another gift entry team member may include the same date in a future export.

    To select the correct transaction date range, navigate to the Gift Exports folder listed above and find the most recent Classy export. Your **transaction start date** should be one day after the end date of the previous export. Your **transaction end date** should be at most the day before today's date. **However, there is no requirement for the how long a report has to be, but a report does need to be at least two days long (such as 10/01/24 - 10/02/24).** During a busy giving season, it is advantageous to use smaller date ranges to avoid fatigue during the gift entry process for Classy batches.

#### Run the One-Time Gift Macro

Once you have correctly exported the Classy report and saved it into the correct location, you must modify the data to fit the Raiser's Edge import structure and format. This can be done via the following process:

1. Open the Classy report CSV file.
2. Run the macro for one-time Classy reports. The current correct macro file is `Arrange_1time_NewClassy_V8.bas` at the time of writing. See the admonition "How to access the Classy One-time Macro" if this is your first time. **Note:** running the macro will create a new file in the same folder with the processed data with *"for review"* after the title.

??? "How to access the Classy One-time Macro"

    The macro files for all Classy report types are located at:

    ```text
    S:\Development\Applications\Raiser's Edge\RE Plugins\Macro Files
    ```

    Here, you can find the `Arrange_1time_NewClassy_V8.bas` file, which is the current correct file for one-time Classy reports. 

??? "How to use the Classy macro?"

    Once you know where the Classy macro is and which file to use, navigate to the Classy report CSV file you want to use it on and open it. Then, you can use the `Alt + F11` shortcut to open the developer window. In the developer window, go to `File > Import` and import the correct classy macro file that you want to use. Finally, close the developer window and then on Excel, navigate to the Macros menu. The Classy macro you selected should be in the Macros menu, and you can now select and run it.

??? "Color code guide on Classy for review file"

    | Color         | Meaning |
    | ------------- | ------- |
    | Gray          | The import will ignore this field. The data is still useful, so do not delete it. |
    | Pink          | Discrepancy between Classy profile name and billing name. The difference can be innocuous, such as capitalization, or it can indicate data you should add to the RE profile, such as a partner or middle name. |
    | Bright Green  | A different appeal from the GEN donation page that most gifts come through. |
    | Light Green   | Indicates presence of a second address line, usually an apartment number. |
    | Purple        | Indicates the appeals being duplicated into the reference field. This comes from Classy Campaign Name and Source Codes. |

#### Pre-process The Data

After running the macro, make some changes to the data before importing it into Raiser's Edge. You can delete unnecessary purple text in the Gift Reference field and modify bright green appeals as needed according to the table below:

#### Save Import File

Once you're done reviewing the data:

1. **Save as CSV (Comma delimited)** and change the file name from "for review" to "for import."
2. Close the CSV file.

#### Import the Data to Raiser's Edge

1. Open Raiser's Edge `ImportOmatic`.
2. Update your Raiser's Edge IND and ORG defaults to the start date of the Classy export date.
3. Select the v8 Classy import profile.
4. Select the "for import" CSV as the file to import.

!!! danger "DO NOT use 'update' or 'add new address'"

    Do not use the "Update" or "Add New Address" buttons during the import process. They do not copy forward the address or include our address defaults. It will also cause that gift to be sent to exceptions.
