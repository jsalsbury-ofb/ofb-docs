# Classy

## Introduction

Classy is an online fundraising platform designed to help nonprofits raise money, engage supporters, and manage campaigns. It provides tools for creating and managing donation pages, peer-to-peer fundraising, events, and crowdfunding efforts.

## Why Do We Process Gifts from Classy?

Most gifts received through OFB's website are processed through Classy, a third party product that charges credit cards via WePay. Donor and donation information are then automatically queued for OFB staff to bring down into an Excel CSV file. You must have a Classy login to bring the info down, and access to the Macro, to be able to process the data and import the gifts via ImportOmatic into RE Gift Batch.
