## Overview of In House Mail Opening

The Oregon Food Bank receives donations via multiple channels. Donations sent directly to OFB by mail are processed by the In House mail opening team, part of Donor Relations. This team plays a key role in preparing donations for entry into the organizationâ€™s records, which includes categorizing gifts and verifying donor information. The final product of this process is the Digital Gift Packet (DGP), which is used by the gift entry team.

## Purpose

The In House mail opening process helps OFB:

- **Ensure Proper Gift Categorization:** By organizing gifts according to their gift appeal, it makes it easier and faster for the gift entry team to process gifts in Raiser's Edge.
- **Identify Large Gifts:** In House mail opening is a part of the process to identify large gifts (over $1,000) which are then compiled into the Large Gift Report (LGR). This further ensures data entry accuracy by helping the gift entry team link to the correct donor and see notes from the gift developers related to gift coding ahead of time.
