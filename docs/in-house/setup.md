# Batch Setup

## Assigning yourself to the batch on Asana

On [Asana], navigate to the **Donations Processing** project. **Donor Relations** will have already created the [Asana] task and moved it to the `Packet Creation` column when it is ready for gift entry. Assign yourself to the task. When you are ready to begin, please move the task to **Batch Input**.
