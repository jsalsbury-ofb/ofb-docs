# Commit and Audit

## Batch Commit

When data entry is completed, commit the batch by selecting the green exclamation point (!) icon in the tools menu of the `Batch` window. This will open the `Commit Gift Batch` window. Please ensure the following options are checked:

- Validate batch before committing
- Do not commit gift (an exception will be created)

Select `Commit now`. During validation, any exceptions or mismatched gift or amount totals will be highlighted. Please resolve any exceptions or mismatched totals before continuing.

- Any custom Lockbox audit queries you have created

If you do not have any of the above queries, please see the [Queries] section to set them up.
