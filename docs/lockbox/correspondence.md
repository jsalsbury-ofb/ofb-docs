# Correspondence Files

## Context

Lockbox separates out image files where constituents did not enclose a gift but did include written communications to us, hence the "correspondence" label. These files typically contain requests for less frequent mailings and notifications of deceased persons. However, these files can also contain requests for credit card payments and bank account transfers. It is important to check these files before or after you process the regular image files during the batch entry process.

!!! tip "What to do with credit card / bank transfer requests"

    Take a snip of the information, note the donor name and `Raisers Edge ID` of the constituent, and please send it to donor relations.

## Accessing Files

You can access the correspondence image files in the same location as the regular Lockbox image files by following the steps in the [Getting Started](./import/#download-image-files-from-us-bank-lockbox) section. The correspondence file names are prefixed with "0009." A file that starts with "09" can be ignored as it does not contain any correspondence from constituents.

## Processing Requests

Processing the specific constituent requests can be handled by following the procedures outlined in the [Constituents](../constituents/index) section.
