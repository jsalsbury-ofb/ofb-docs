## What is a Lockbox Service?

A lockbox service is a way for businesses to receive customer payments through a third-party processor, usually a bank, instead of directly to the business. The service is designed to speed up the payment collection process and provide timely payment information to update accounts receivable records.

## How does it work?

1. A business asks customers to send payments to a special post office box (P.O. Box) that's controlled by the bank, rather than the business.
2. The bank collects the payments from the P.O. Box on a daily basis.
3. The bank opens and processes the payments, including scanning checks.
4. The bank deposits the funds directly into the business's bank account.
5. The bank generates a file of customer payments to send to the business to automatically update their accounts receivable system. The information can also be integrated into accounting software.

## Setting up a US Bank Lockbox account
